<h3>Many commercial and government field forces deploy a rugged portable computer with their fleet of vehicles. This requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and ergonomics. Rugged computers are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off-road driving and the harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in emergency medical services, fire, and public safety.</h3>

<h4>Other elements affecting function in the vehicle:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Operating temperature: A vehicle cabin can often experience temperature swings from ?30–60 °C (?22–140 °F). Computers typically must be able to withstand these temperatures while operating. Typical fan-based cooling has stated limits of 35–38 °C (95–100 °F) of ambient temperature and temperatures below freezing require localized heaters to bring components up to operating temperature (based on independent studies by the SRI Group and by Panasonic R&D).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Vibration can decrease the life expectancy of computer components, notably rotational storage such as HDDs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Visibility of standard screens becomes an issue in bright sunlight.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Touchscreen users easily interact with the units in the field without removing gloves.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>High-temperature battery settings: Lithium-ion batteries are sensitive to high-temperature conditions for charging. A computer designed for the mobile environment should be designed with a high-temperature charging function that limits the charge to 85% or less of capacity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>External antenna connections go through the typical metal cabins of vehicles which would block wireless reception and take advantage of much more capable external communication and navigation equipment.</li>
</ul>
